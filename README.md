# Python Term 1 Week 6 Saturday class

# If else Practice activity

# Building a calculator

Build a calculator that takes 3 inputs from the user:
2 inputs as numbers (Floats) for operations and 3rd input to decide which operation they want to perform.

# Lists
Composite Data type, meaning multiple data types can ne stored in one variable.
Each piece is called an element.

# Loops

Like Post Malone describes, "Run Away, but we're runnign in circles"
Used to repeat a block of code multiple times untill a certain condition is met.

DRY  Coding Principle: Don't Repeat Yourself.

Example: Counting coins in your piggy bank

"If" conditions would decide whether or not to run the intended block, whereas, Loops would decide how many times the user wants to run the intended block.

# While loop
While the condition is met, keep excecuting the intended block. If not met, skip the block.

Thing to consider:
    - Program can enter the loop
    - Program can exit the loop (use ctrl c)
